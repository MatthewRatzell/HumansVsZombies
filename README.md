# HumansVsZombies
Matthew Ratzell
IGME, Section 2

Assignment:
HvZ part 2

Description:
Creating a park populated by humans and zombies.The zombies will seek humans and the humans will flee zombies. Pursue, Evade, Wander, Seperation, Obstacle Avoidance, and Boundary Checking are all leveraged to create this.


User Responsibilities:
The user does not have a job, and they simply must watch the zombies chase the humans. The user may click the corresponding buttons to spawn in either a random human or a random zombie.

Controls
D-Enables and disables(toggles) debug lines.


Above and Beyond:
Stylized environment using assets created for another class, as well as interactive buttons that either spawn in a random human or a random zombie

Known Issues:
There are no known issues, I attempted to balance everything as best as I could, humans don't fare the best when they get pushed into the walls, but overall it came out pretty decent. Every 20 or so playthroughs a bad run can happen and the zombies won't be able to catch the humans because the humans run out of the map and the zombies stay attached. This seems to be RNG based on their random spawns and doesn't happen often.
